• **So what is LinkBridge?** <br />

According to the Global Report of Entrepreneurs Amway 2015, Mexico is emerging as the second most entrepreneurial country. Since 2016, the number of Fintech enterprises in Mexico has grown at an average rate of 23% per year, according to Mexico’s Fintech Radar. According to the same source, 441 startups have been identified within Mexico. That is a 12% increase in the number of start-ups mentioned in the previous edition of Fintech Radar that was published in June 2019, where 394 startups Fintech were identified in Mexico. However, there are people who do not know how to wisely invest their money. Many entrepreneurs do not develop their projects due to the lack of having access to capital. Only 5% of companies that get established in Mexico last more than two years. LinkBridge is a Mexico-based registered company offering an ecosystem aiming at connecting entrepreneurs, investors and professionals dedicated to increasing the chances of projects to be successfully implemented. In other words, LinkBridge aims at becoming a unique bridge between the mentioned parties. By using the LinkBridge App, entrepreneurs, investors and professionals would be able to easily connect with each other.  <br /> <br />

Almost one third of startups in Mexico operate in the financial services sector, followed by health, information and communication technologies (ICT), and education. Startup ecosystems are  distributed within Mexico. 32% of startups are in Mexico City; 10% in Guadalajara; and 8% in Monterrey. One of the Mexican ecosystems that has been brewing for a while now is “Startup Links”, which offers, according to its page, upon the registration of startup the ability to find mentors, strategic alliances and funds. Currently, there are 400 million potential users within Mexico and the United States alone. One of the goals of LinkBridge is to allow at least 25% of the companies that use its App/platform prosper. <br /> <br />

By helping different stakeholders accomplish the mentioned goals, LinkBridge would be able to generate income through the following means: <br />

•Subscriptions / Memberships. <br />
•% Share of Start-ups. <br />
•Consultation fees. <br />
•Participation in projects. <br />
•Certifications. <br />
•Entrepreneurship courses. <br />
•Networking forums. <br />
•Referrals. <br /> <br />

The implementation of LinkBridge would take place in three stages. Stage 1 is to start as an ecosystem that is able to privately offer securities for the first 100 shareholders per company. In stage 2, LinkBridge would focus on the niche of Technology companies that are regarded as a market places. For stage 3, LinkBridge would focus on FTIs (Financial Technology Institutions), better known as FINTECHs.
