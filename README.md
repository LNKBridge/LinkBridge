<br /> # LinkBridge
<br /> LinkBridge is an ecosystem that aims at connecting entrepreneurs, investors and professionals dedicated to increasing the chances of projects to be successfully implemented. 
<br /> Currently there are people who do not know where to invest their money and entrepreneurs who do not develop their projects due to lack of capital. We want to be the bridge between them through a Web App that allows them to connect.
Only 5% of companies that open in 4 Mexico last more than two years. Our goal is that at least 25% of the companies that use LinkBridge prosper. 400 million possible users between Mexico and the United States.

Our idea is to start as an ecosystem of private offer of securities for the first 100 shareholders per company, starting with the niche of Technology companies, in stage two as Market Place, and stage 3 ITF (Financial Technology Institutions) better known as FINTECH.
Mexico is emerging as the second most entrepreneurial country, according to the Global Report of Entrepreneurs Amway 2015. The first place is Denmark, with 96%, Mexico and Colombia, with 91%.
Almost one third of startups operate in the financial services sector, followed by health, information and communication technologies (ICT), and education. Jobs and livelihoods are priorities in the most common areas of impact. 
Mexico is the country where startup ecosystems are most distributed in the territory, with 32% startups in Mexico City, 10% in Guadalajara and 8% in Monterrey.
Since 2016, the number of Fintech enterprises in Mexico has grown at an average rate of 23% per year, according to Mexico’s Fintech Radar.
In Fintech Radar 441 startups have been identified in the sector, 12% more than in the previous edition published in June 2019, with 394 startups Fintech identified in Mexico.
One of the Mexican ecosystems that is brewing this year is “Startup Links” that offers according to its page when registering the startup find mentors, strategic allies and funds.
An entry barrier is to communicate and spread the platform so that it reaches more entrepreneurs by creating a support network.
